## What do you love to do at work?

The first thing I like at work is to comminicate and collaborate whit my team members. I like to focus on pririoties tasks and complete any tasks before the deadline. 
Secondly I like the meetings and stand up sessions where we have opportunity to refresh our mind about the current job(project) requirements or goals and and focus on that. Regular meetings is the best time to ask questions in order to clear any doubts.

## Talk about a time that you required input from a co-worker who was not being responsive, but you needed to get their input for you to continue. How did you handle this situation?

I worked on a project where the scrum master left the team. This was the crutial time for my team because no body was ready to take the risq of this role. I had no prio knowledge of the scrum master role but I used to be a store manager where I was working with eleven(11) employees. Using my soft skills of manager I kept my role and I decided to play the scrum master. I motivated my team and we were able to complete the project on time.
